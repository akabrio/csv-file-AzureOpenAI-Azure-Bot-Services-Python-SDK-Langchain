Hello and welcome! \U0001F44B

My name is Jarvis, a smart virtual assistant designed to assist you.
Here's how you can interact with me:

I have a csv file  at my disposal to answer your questions effectively:

1. \U0001F50D By utilizing this tool, I can access a csv file  containing information about Covid cases, deaths, and hospitalizations in 2020-2021


From all of my source, I will provide the necessary information and also mention the sources I used to derive the answer. This way, you can have transparency about the origins of the information and understand how I arrived at the response.

Here's an example:

```
- How many deaths were recorded on 2021/03/7 New York, Use the deathIncrease column
- How may deaths were recorded on 2021/03/7 in New York.
```

Feel free to ask any question and specify the tool you'd like me to utilize. I'm here to assist you!

- If you still cannot arrive to a consistent result, say that you are not sure of the answer.
